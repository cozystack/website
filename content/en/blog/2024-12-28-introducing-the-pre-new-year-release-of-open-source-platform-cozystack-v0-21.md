### Introducing the Pre-New Year Release of open source platform Cozystack v0.21: New User Dashboard, Talos Linux,Â etc.

The dashboard now works directly with the Cozystack API instead of relying on FluxCD resources. This enhancement enables the platform to provide a user-friendly graphical interface while integrating with Kubernetesâ€™ standard RBAC model for managing deployment permissions.

Each tenant now includes four default groups:  
`view`: Read-only access.  
`use`: Access to virtual machines and service usage.  
`admin`: Ability to deploy core services (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes, virtual machines, etc.).  
`super-admin`: Manage child tenants and deploy service-level components (monitoring, etcd, ingress, seaweedfs, etc.).

Group members can access the platform via both Kubernetes and the dashboard.

While we maintain an API-driven philosophy, the dashboard remains an essential feature. It allows users to quickly configure services through a graphical interface, explore how they map to the API, and then transition to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

**Key Dashboard Improvements  
**- Direct interaction with the Cozystack API instead of FluxCD resources.  
- Application names in the catalog now reflect their corresponding Kind in the Cozystack API.  
- Application prefixes removedâ€Šâ€”â€Šeach app now uses its own Kind.  
- Namespaces filtered by the tenant- prefix to display only user-specific namespaces while hiding system namespaces.  
- Fixed icon rendering issues when OIDC is enabled.  
- Cosmetic improvements, including corrected links to documentation.

**Additional Updates  
**- Added authorization support for Redis.  
- Refactored tenant roles and role bindings, removing permissions for HelmRelease resources and the kubeapps-admin group.  
- Fixed Grafana startup issues and updated the plugin URL for VictoriaLogs.  
- Updated OpenAPI specifications for List resources in the Cozystack API.  
- Talos Linux upgraded to v1.8.4.  
- linstor-ha-controller updated to v1.2.3, resolving high availability issues for virtual machines.  
- Introduced configurable database size for Grafana.  
- Enhanced resource management for VMCluster resources.
