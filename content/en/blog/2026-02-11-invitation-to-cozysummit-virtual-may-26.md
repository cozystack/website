Join us on May 26 for 2nd CozySummit Virtual, conference for CozyStack developers and adopters.

📢 CFP is open until March 8 – submit your talk and become speaker at our event!

CozySummit Virtual is organized by CNCF with the support of CozyStack maintainers and project sponsors.

Suggested Session Topics:
1. Cozystack in Production: Real-world deep dives into architecture, observability, and the hard parts of running production-grade clouds.
2. Built-in Compliance: Practical frameworks for deploying compliance-driven environments, including local infrastructure designs and governance that keep workloads and data under your control.
3. Hyperscaler Alternatives: Real-life cases and models for building your own public or private cloud that can compete with global providers on local markets while reducing infrastructure costs by 2x–5x.
4. Automation & GitOps: Deep dives into platform engineering: integrations (IAM, networking, storage, monitoring), GitOps/automation workflows, and building self-service developer platforms on top of Cozystack.
5. Community & Maintainership: A direct look at release engineering, contributing new modules, and community practices that help Cozystack grow.
6. Feel free to suggest your topic if you don't see here what you have in mind💪
