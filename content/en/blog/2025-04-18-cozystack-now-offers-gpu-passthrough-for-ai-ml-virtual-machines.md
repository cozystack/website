### **Cozystack Now Offers GPU Passthrough for AI/ML Virtual Machines**

The open-source cloud platform has introduced direct GPU passthrough in its latest release, enabling users to accelerate AI, machine learning, and other compute-intensive workloads on virtual machines. By leveraging physical GPUs from host nodes, teams can now deploy open-source AI stacks without proprietary cloud dependencies.

#### What is Cozystack

Cozystack is a free PaaS and framework for building clouds that unifies VMs, containers, and GPU workloads under Kubernetes. With KubeVirt integration, multi-tenancy, and bare-metal simplicity, it lets enterprises deploy AI, databases, or edge apps without vendor lock-in. And service providers can turn hardware into a cloud business: sell managed K8s, VMs and GPU services. CNCF Sandbox project.
