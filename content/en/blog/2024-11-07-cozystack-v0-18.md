### Cozystack v0.18 Release: Public API Server, Metrics and Logs from Tenant Clusters, and Other Improvements

### ðŸ”¥ Public API for Cozystack

This is the biggest and most anticipated update for us. Cozystack now includes its own Kubernetes API server, which automatically translates all requests to custom resources into HelmReleases.

This means that platform administrators can now provide users with granular access to specific resources (Kuberneteses, VirtualMachines, Postgresses, etc.). Additionally, the API server can be easily extended with additional components by simply listing them in a ConfigMapâ€Šâ€”â€Šno recompilation required.

However, note that the dashboard still interacts with HelmReleases directly, so itâ€™s not recommended to give end-users access to it just yet.

A demo of the API server and a guide on how to work with it can be found in the recording of the latest Cozystack community meeting (use the timestamps in the video description as a guide): [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn1ryGRtTGE).

### Configuring Metrics and Logs Collection from TenantÂ Clusters

In the Kubernetes configuration for tenant clusters, thereâ€™s now an option to enable the monitoring agents addon. When enabled, all metrics and logs are automatically redirected to the monitoring system deployed within the userâ€™s tenant space.

### Other Changes

\- Database operators have been made optional components in the distro-full and distro-hosted editions.  
- Talos Linux has been updated to version v1.8.2.  
- Fixed the webhook in Alerta for managing alerts via Telegram.  
- Removed redundant alerts.  
- Added basic e2e tests to verify the deployment of each application.
