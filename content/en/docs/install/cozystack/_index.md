**The third step** in deploying a Cozystack cluster is to install Cozystack on a Kubernetes cluster that has been previously installed and configured on Talos Linux nodes.
A prerequisite to this step is having [installed a Kubernetes cluster]({{% ref "/docs/install/kubernetes" %}}).

If this is your first time installing Cozystack, consider starting with the [Cozystack tutorial]({{% ref "/docs/getting-started" %}}).

This section is a work in progress.
For a guide on installing Cozystack on a Kubernetes cluster, see the [Cozystack tutorial]({{% ref "/docs/getting-started/install-cozystack" %}}).
