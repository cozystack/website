    B --> D[Alerta]
    E[Fluent Bit] --> F[VLogs]
```

## Component Descriptions

- **VMAgent**: A lightweight agent that collects metrics from various sources and sends them to VictoriaMetrics.
- **VMCluster**: A VictoriaMetrics cluster that stores and processes time-series data for efficient querying.
- **Grafana**: An open-source platform for monitoring and observability with customizable dashboards.
- **Alerta**: An alerting system that processes and manages alerts from monitoring systems.
- **Fluent Bit**: A fast and lightweight log processor and forwarder.
- **VLogs**: VictoriaLogs, a high-performance log management system for storing and querying logs.
