This section provides practical guidance for working with Cozystack bundles.
Youâ€™ll also find detailed reference pages for each bundle, outlining their structure, included components, and expected environment.

* [paas-full]
* [paas-hosted]
* [distro-full]
* [distro-hosted]

[paas-full]: {{% ref "/docs/operations/bundles/paas-full" %}}

### How to overwrite parameters for specific components

You might want to overwrite specific options for the components.r
To achieve this, you must specify values in JSON or YAML format using the values-<component> option.

For example, if you want to overwrite `k8sServiceHost` and `k8sServicePort` for cilium,
take a look at its [values.yaml](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/238061efbc0da61d60068f5de31d6eaa35c4d994/packages/system/cilium/values.yaml#L18-L19) file.

Then specify these options in the `values-cilium` section of your Cozystack configuration, as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-system
data:
  bundle-name: "distro-full"
  ipv4-pod-cidr: "10.244.0.0/16"
  ipv4-svc-cidr: "10.96.0.0/16"
  values-cilium: |
    cilium:
      k8sServiceHost: 11.22.33.44
      k8sServicePort: 6443
```

### How to enable and disable bundle components

Bundles have optional components that need to be explicitly enabled (included) in the installation.
Regular bundle components can, on the other hand, be disabled (excluded) from the installation, when you don't need them.

Use options `bundle-enable` and `bundle-disable`, providing comma-separated lists of the components.
For example, [installing Cozystack in Hetzner]({{% ref "/docs/install/providers/hetzner" %}})
requires swapping default load balancer, MetalLB, with one made specifically for Hetzner, called RobotLB:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-system
data:
  bundle-name: "paas-full"
  bundle-disable: "metallb"
  bundle-enable: "hetzner-robotlb"
  # rest of the config
```

Disabling components must be done before installing Cozystack.
Applying updated configuration with `bundle-disable` will not remove components that are already installed.
To remove already installed components, delete the Helm release manually using this command:

```bash
kubectl delete hr -n <namespace> <component>
```
