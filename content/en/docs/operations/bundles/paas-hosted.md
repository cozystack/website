This is a Cozystack platform configuration intended for use as a PaaS platform, designed for installation on existing Kubernetes clusters.

This configuration can be used with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and any cloud-based Kubernetes clusters.
It does not include CNI plugins, virtualization, or storage.

The Kubernetes cluster used to deploy Cozystack must conform to the following requirements:

* All CNI plugins must be disabled, as Cozystack will install its own plugin.
* Kubernetes cluster DNS domain must be set to `cozy.local`.
* Listening address of some Kubernetes components must be changed from `localhost` to a routeable address.
* Kubernetes API server must be reachable on `localhost`.


### Example configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cozystack
  namespace: cozy-system
data:
  bundle-name: "paas-hosted"
  root-host: example.org
  api-server-endpoint: https://192.168.100.10:6443
  expose-services: "api,dashboard"
```
