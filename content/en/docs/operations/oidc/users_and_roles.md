Creating users and add roles for them

### Overview

When a tenant is created in Cozy (starting with version 1.6.0), roles, RoleBindings and keycloak groups will automatically be created in the Kubernetes cluster.

To create a user, refer to the following documentation:
[Keycloak Admin Console Documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#using-the-admin-console)

## Assigning a Role to a User for a Tenant

1. **Access Keycloak**:
   To retrieve login credentials, check the secret by running the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl get secret keycloak-credentials -n cozy-keycloak -o yaml
   ```
   **Keycloak Address**:
   The Keycloak address will match the value specified in the cozystack ConfigMap. For example, if your ConfigMap looks like this:
   ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    name: cozystack
    namespace: cozy-system
    data:
    root-host: infra.example.org
    api-server-adress: 55.21.33.22
    bundle-name: "paas-full"
    ipv4-pod-cidr: "10.244.0.0/16"
    ipv4-pod-gateway: "10.244.0.1"
    ipv4-svc-cidr: "10.96.0.0/16"
    ipv4-join-cidr: "100.64.0.0/16"
   ```
   Then Keycloak will be available at: `keycloak.infra.example.org`

  {{% alert color="warning" %}}
  If you are planning to integrate with external services either as clients or as IdPs, your Keycloak address needs to be publicly accessible and reachable by these services.
