Golden images in Cozystack allow administrators to prepare **named operating system images** that users can later reuse when creating virtual machines.  
This guide explains the benefits of golden images, how to create them, and how to use them when deploying VMs.

By default, every time a user creates a virtual machine, Cozystack downloads the required image from its source URL.  
This can become a bottleneck when multiple VMs are created in quick succession.  
Golden images solve this problem by caching the image locally, eliminating repeated downloads and speeding up deployment.

## Naming Conventions (Important)

Cozystack automatically adds prefixes to internal Kubernetes resources:

| User-visible name | Resource Kind | Actual resource name |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| `<image>`         | DataVolume in `cozy-public` (golden image) | `vm-image-<image>` |
| `<disk>`          | DataVolume created from VMDisk             | `vm-disk-<disk>`   |
| `<vm>`            | VirtualMachine created from VMInstance     | `vm-instance-<vm>` |

This means if you create a VMInstance named `ubuntu`, the VirtualMachine in Kubernetes will be `vm-instance-ubuntu`.


## Creating Golden Images

Creating named VM images (golden images) requires an administrator account in Cozystack.

The simplest way to create named VM images is by using the CLI script.  
The [`cdi_golden_image_create.sh`](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/main/hack/cdi_golden_image_create.sh) script can be downloaded from the Cozystack repository:

```bash
wget https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/main/hack/cdi_golden_image_create.sh
chmod +x cdi_golden_image_create.sh
```

This script uses your `kubectl` configuration.  
Before running it, ensure that your configuration points to the target Cozystack cluster.

To create a named image, or to download one of the default images, run the script with the image name and its URL:

```bash
cdi_golden_image_create.sh '<name>' 'https://<image-url>'
```

For example, all five default images, available with the `virtual-machine` application, can be downloaded for faster use:

```bash
cdi_golden_image_create.sh 'ubuntu' 'https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img'
cdi_golden_image_create.sh 'fedora' 'https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/40/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-Generic.x86_64-40-1.14.qcow2'
cdi_golden_image_create.sh 'cirros' 'https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.6.2/cirros-0.6.2-x86_64-disk.img'
cdi_golden_image_create.sh 'alpine' 'https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/cloud/nocloud_alpine-3.20.2-x86_64-bios-tiny-r0.qcow2'
cdi_golden_image_create.sh 'talos' 'https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/download/v1.7.6/nocloud-amd64.raw.xz'
```

Internally, the script creates Kubernetes resources of `kind: DataVolume` in the `cozy-public` namespace.
The resource name is the diskâ€™s name prefixed with `vm-image-`.
For example, the resource `vm-image-ubuntu` creates a saved image named `ubuntu`.

You can track the process by running the following commands:
```bash
kubectl -n cozy-public get dv
kubectl -n cozy-public describe dv vm-image-ubuntu
```

## Using Golden Images

### Simple Virtual Machine

Simple virtual machines (deployed with the `virtual-machine` application in Cozystack) already include a set of predefined named disk images.
By default, users can choose from `ubuntu`, `fedora`, `cirros`, `alpine`, and `talos`.

These images are named but, in the default configuration, they are downloaded each time a VM is created.
Using golden images allows these files to be downloaded once and stored locally, significantly speeding up VM deployment.

The next step is to create a VMDisk, which we will later attach to our future VM:

```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: VMDisk
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
spec:
  source:
    image:
      name: ubuntu
EOF
```

You can monitor the process using the following commands:
```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root get vmdisk
kubectl -n tenant-root get dv
kubectl -n tenant-root describe dv vm-disk-ubuntu
```

Next, we need to create a VMInstance:
```bash
kubectl -n tenant-root create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: apps.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: VMInstance
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
spec:
  disks:
  - name: ubuntu
EOF
```

You can check the status of the VirtualMachine with:
```bash
kubectl get vm -n tenant-root
```

To connect to the VM, run:
```bash
virtctl console vm-instance-ubuntu -n tenant-root
```
